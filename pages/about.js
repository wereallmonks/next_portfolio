        My road to programming started in college, but only recently did I enjoy seeing my creations unfold before my eyes into something user-friendly, accessible, and interesting.
        <h2>When I am not coding, you will find me making meals with friends, baking, kickboxing, doing yoga, reading, and hanging out with my little family: husband, Ryan, and tortie Siamese, Len√π.</h2>
      </div>
         <p>Check out what I've been reading!</p>
        <div>
         <h1>And if you're interested, this is what I've been listening to lately</h1>
         <Spotify />
         <p>Part IV of a series of playlists Ryan made for me during this pandemic. I highly recommend giving it a listen.</p>
