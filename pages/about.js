                  My inquisitive nature led me to pursue a degree in physics,
                  but it also opened a door to a world where wonder and
                  creativity would evolve and blend together with programming.
                  In college I learned the basics of writing programs with tools
                  such as Fortran and C++, and afterwards I continued learning
                  on my own. I became hooked on JavaScript and began creating
                  applications for the web. I love seeing how it all unfolds
                  into something user-friendly, accessible, and interesting.

                  When I am not coding, you will find me making meals with
                  friends, baking, kickboxing, doing yoga, reading, and hanging
                  out with my little family: husband, Ryan [add a link], and
                  tortie Siamese, Len√π. [Maybe a picture could go here?

                  I also collect records and I'm a big music nerd. If you're
                  interested, this is what I've been listening to lately as well
                  as my current favorite playlist.
