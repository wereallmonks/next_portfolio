      <h1>More about me and my interests</h1>
      <div>
        My inquisitive nature led me to pursue a degree in physics, but it also
        opened a door to a world where wonder and creativity would evolve and
        blend together with programming. In college I learned the basics of
        writing programs with tools such as Fortran and C++, but afterwards I
        contined learning on my own. I became addicted to JavaScript and began
        creating applications for the web. I love seeing how it all unfolds into
        something user-friendly, accessible, and interesting.
        <br />
        When I am not coding, you will find me making meals with friends,
        baking, kickboxing, doing yoga, reading, and hanging out with my little
        family: husband, Ryan, and tortie Siamese, Len√π.

        I also collect records and I'm a big music nerd. If you're interested,
        this is what I've been listening to lately

        Part IV of a series of playlists Ryan made for me during this pandemic.
        I highly recommend giving it a listen.
