      <h1>More about me and my interests</h1>
      <div>
        My love for science led me to pursue a degree in physics, and it also
        opened the door to a world where my love for problem solving and
        creativity would evolve and blend together. In college I learned the
        basics of programming, but afterwards I would contine learning on my
        own. I became addicted to creating applications for the web and seeing
        how it all unfolds into something user-friendly, accessible, and
        interesting.
        <h2>
          When I am not coding, you will find me making meals with friends,
          baking, kickboxing, doing yoga, reading, and hanging out with my
          little family: husband, Ryan, and tortie Siamese, Len√π.

        I also collect records and I'm a big music nerd. If you're interested,
        this is what I've been listening to lately
