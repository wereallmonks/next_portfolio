      <h1>More about me and my interests</h1>
        <p>I love JavaScript. It opened new doors for me, specifically a new fascination with React. When I am not coding, you will find me behind a book, cooking or doing yoga with friends, learning French, spinning records and making playlists, or hanging out with my little family (my husband, Ryan, and tortie Siamese, Len√π).</p>

         <p>Part IV of a series of playlists Ryan made for me during this pandemic. I highly recommend giving it a listen.</p>
